# Onboarding Deep Learning Assignment
Onboarding deep learning project using PyTorch to classify digits in the MNIST dataset. This project was made in a Google Colab Python notebook, which can be viewed in the ipynb file. I have also put the py file in this repo if there are any issues with the Colab file.
